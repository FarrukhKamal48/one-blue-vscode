# one-blue
I made one dark pro slightly more blueish.

# How to install?

Currently, I have'nt uploaded this theme to the vscode market place (because it's too long of a process and I'm lazy :] )

So to install:
- Download the `one-blue-0.0.1.vsix` file

- `cd` in to the folder you saved the `.vsix` file.

- Run the following cammand to install the theme:
    ```
    code --install-extension one-blue-0.0.1.vsix
    ```

- Open `command pallet`
- Select `Preferences: Color Theme`
- Select `One Blue`
- Reload vscode
